Game Mechanics
==============

Empire Builder features deep strategic gameplay with multiple interconnected systems. This guide explains the core mechanics and how they work together.

Core Concepts
-------------

Empire Management
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Empire Creation**
When you first join the game, you create an empire with:
- Unique empire name
- Starting location on the world map
- Initial resources (1000 gold, 500 food, 200 materials)
- Basic infrastructure (town hall, 1 house, 1 farm)

**Resource System**
Three primary resources drive your empire:

- **Gold** üí∞: Primary currency for buildings, units, and trade
- **Food** üåæ: Required to feed population and maintain armies
- **Materials** üî®: Used for construction and military equipment

Resources are produced by buildings and consumed by population, military units, and construction projects.

City Building
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Building Types**

*Economic Buildings:*
- **Houses**: Increase population capacity (+10 population each)
- **Farms**: Produce food (+5 food/hour each)
- **Markets**: Generate gold (+3 gold/hour each)
