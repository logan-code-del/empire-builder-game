## Technical Implementation

### Database Schema

#### Users Table
```sql
CREATE TABLE users (
    id TEXT PRIMARY KEY,
    username TEXT UNIQUE NOT NULL,
    email TEXT UNIQUE NOT NULL,
    password_hash TEXT NOT NULL,
    salt TEXT NOT NULL,
    created_at TEXT NOT NULL,
    last_login TEXT,
    is_active BOOLEAN DEFAULT 1,
    empire_id TEXT,
    FOREIGN KEY (empire_id) REFERENCES empires (id)
);
```

#### User Sessions Table
```sql
CREATE TABLE user_sessions (
    id TEXT PRIMARY KEY,
    user_id TEXT NOT NULL,
    session_token TEXT UNIQUE NOT NULL,
    created_at TEXT NOT NULL,
    expires_at TEXT NOT NULL,
    is_active BOOLEAN DEFAULT 1,
    ip_address TEXT,
    user_agent TEXT,
    FOREIGN KEY (user_id) REFERENCES users (id)
);
```

### API Endpoints

- All `/api/*` endpoints

### Security Measures

1. **Password Security**:

   - 100,000 iterations for slow hashing
   - Unique salt per password
   - Minimum 6 character requirement

2. **Session Security**:
   - Secure session tokens
   - 30-day expiration with "Remember Me"
   - IP address and user agent tracking
   - Automatic cleanup of expired sessions

3. **Input Validation**:
   - Username: 3-20 characters, alphanumeric + underscore
   - Email: Valid email format required
   - Password: Minimum 6 characters
   - Client-side and server-side validation

4. **Route Protection**:
   - `@login_required` decorator on all protected routes
   - Automatic redirection to login page
   - JSON API error responses for AJAX requests

## File Structure

```
empire/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ auth.py                 # Authentication system core
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ app.py                  # Main application (updated with auth)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ templates/
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ login.html         # Login page
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ register.html      # Registration page
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ base.html          # Updated navigation with auth
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ test_auth.py           # Authentication testing script
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ AUTHENTICATION_GUIDE.md # This documentation
```

## Testing

Run the authentication test script:
```bash
cd empire
python test_auth.py
```

This will verify:
- Registration page accessibility
- Login page functionality
- Protected route security
- Main page authentication options

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **"Username already exists"**
   - Choose a different username
   - Usernames must be unique across all users

2. **"Invalid username or password"**
   - Check your credentials carefully
   - Passwords are case-sensitive

3. **"Authentication required" errors**
   - You need to log in to access game features
   - Sessions may have expired

4. **Registration form validation errors**
   - Ensure all fields are filled correctly
   - Password must be at least 6 characters
   - Username can only contain letters, numbers, and underscores

### Database Issues

If you encounter database errors:
1. The authentication system automatically creates required tables
2. Existing empires are preserved and can be linked to new user accounts
3. The system handles database migrations automatically

## Migration from Old System

If you have existing empires from before the authentication system:
1. Create a new user account
2. Your existing empire data is preserved in the database
3. Contact an administrator to link your old empire to your new account if needed

## Security Best Practices

1. **Use Strong Passwords**: Minimum 6 characters, include numbers and symbols
2. **Keep Credentials Safe**: Don't share your login information
3. **Log Out**: Always log out when using shared computers
4. **Regular Updates**: Keep your email address current for account recovery

## Future Enhancements

Planned features for future versions:
- Password reset via email
- Two-factor authentication (2FA)
- Account settings page
- Empire transfer between accounts
- Admin panel for user management
- OAuth integration (Google, Discord, etc.)

## Support

If you encounter any issues with the authentication system:
1. Check this guide for common solutions
2. Verify the server is running properly
3. Check browser console for JavaScript errors
4. Ensure cookies are enabled in your browser
