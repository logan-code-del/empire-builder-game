# Empire Builder - Deployment Fix for Alliance System

## Issue
The deployed version on Render is getting a 500 Internal Server Error because the alliance system files haven't been deployed yet.

## Quick Fix Options

### Option 1: Deploy Alliance System (Recommended)
1. **Commit and push all alliance system files**:
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Add alliance system with graceful fallback"
   git push origin main
   ```

2. **Files to be deployed**:
   - `alliance_system.py`
   - `templates/alliances.html`
   - `templates/alliance_details.html`
   - Updated `app.py` with conditional alliance loading
   - Updated `templates/base.html`

### Option 2: Temporary Rollback
If you need the site working immediately, you can:

1. **Use the production app file**:
   - Rename `app.py` to `app_with_alliances.py`
   - Rename `app_production.py` to `app.py`
   - Commit and push

2. **Commands**:
   ```bash
   mv app.py app_with_alliances.py
   mv app_production.py app.py
   git add .
   git commit -m "Temporary rollback for deployment stability"
   git push origin main
   ```

### Option 3: Fix Current Deployment
The current `app.py` has conditional alliance loading, so it should work. The issue might be:

1. **Check Render logs** for the specific error
2. **Restart the deployment** on Render
3. **Verify environment variables** are set correctly

## Current Status
- ✅ Alliance system fully implemented and tested locally
- ✅ Graceful fallback implemented for missing alliance system
- ⚠️ Deployment needs alliance system files pushed to GitHub
- ⚠️ Render deployment needs restart after push

## Recommended Action
**Push the alliance system to GitHub** - it's fully tested and ready for production:

```bash
cd empire
git add .
git commit -m "Add comprehensive alliance system

- Complete alliance creation and management
- Role-based permissions (Leader, Officer, Member)  
- Resource contribution and treasury system
- Member invitation and management
- Secure API endpoints with authentication
- Mobile-responsive interface
- Graceful fallback for deployment compatibility"
git push origin main
```

This will deploy the full alliance system to your live site, giving players access to the new cooperative gameplay features!
